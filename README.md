# FAN-temperature-controller

**Idea:**

This project aims to create a temperature-controlled fan using an ATmega32 Microcontroller. We will use the  H-bridge and DC-Motor instead of the Fan and the functionality of the H-bridge is to turn on the DC Motor, and therefore they will give us the same usage as the Fan. The motor and the Green-LED will automatically turned on when the temperature is equals to or exceeds 30 degrees Celsius, otherwise the Red-LED will be turned on and the motor turned off.

**Hardware Components:**

• ATmega32 Microcontroller

• Temperature sensor (e.g., LM35)

• Motor driver (L293D)

• DC Motor

• LCD display

• Green and Red LED’s
